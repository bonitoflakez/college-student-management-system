# College Student Management System

## **Project Description**

The College Student Management System is a web application built using React.js, TypeScript, and Next.js, designed to streamline various tasks and provide essential functionalities for college students. This system aims to improve the overall college experience by offering tools and features that simplify academic and administrative processes.

### Functionalities

1. **User Authentication:** Allow students to register and log in securely using email and password or social media accounts.

2. **Dashboard (Dashboard Component):** Create a dashboard component to display statistics and announcements Fetch and display data from the server, such as the number of students, faculty members, and recent announcements.

3. **Student Management (CRUD operations):** Create components for adding, editing, and deleting student records Implement forms for inputting student details and use React state management for data handling. Fetch and display a list of students from the server.

4. **Faculty Management (CRUD operations):** Build components for adding, editing, and deleting faculty members. Create forms for faculty member details input. Implement association of faculty members with specific courses.

5. **File Upload and Storage (local storage/cloud):** Allow for file uploads and storage using a local/cloud storage service. Enable students and faculty to upload documents like transcripts and assignments.

6. **Announcements and Notifications (Hint: Use real-time updates(Next.js/typescript ))** Allow admins to post announcements. Notify students and faculty of important updates in real-time. Implement a calendar for scheduling classes, exams, and other events.

7. **Search and Filtering (Search and filter options):** Implement search and filter functionality for students, courses, and faculty members.

8. **Mobile Responsiveness (Responsive design):** Ensure your application is responsive by using responsive design principles and CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Material-UI)

9. **Role-Based Access Control (Role-based permissions):** Define roles (admin, faculty, student) and implement role-based access control. Restrict access to specific functionalities based on user roles.

10. **Reports and Analytics (Hint: Implement data visualization)** Collect and store relevant data about students, courses, and attendance. This data could be stored in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) on the server-side of your application. Create React components to display the charts and reports. Fetch data from the backend API using Axios or the Fetch API. Utilize the chosen data visualization library (Chart.js, D3.js, or React-Chartjs-2) to render charts and graphs based on the fetched data. Implement routing in Next.js to navigate between different sections of the application. Implement endpoints to fetch data for students, courses, and attendance.
