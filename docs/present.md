## Purpose

The purpose of the College Student Management System is to provide a comprehensive web application that streamlines various tasks and delivers essential functionalities for college students. This system is designed to enhance the overall college experience by offering tools and features that simplify academic and administrative processes.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project include:

1. **User Authentication:** Implement a secure user authentication system that allows college students to register and log in using their email and password or social media accounts.

2. **Dashboard:** Create a dashboard component to provide students with valuable information, statistics, and announcements. Data from the server, such as the number of students, faculty members, and recent announcements, will be displayed.

3. **Student Management:** Develop features for managing student records, including the ability to add, edit, and delete student information. Use React state management for data handling and implement forms for inputting student details.

4. **Faculty Management:** Build features for managing faculty members, including adding, editing, and deleting faculty records. Create forms for inputting faculty member details and enable the association of faculty members with specific courses.

5. **File Upload and Storage:** Implement a system for file uploads and storage, allowing students and faculty to upload documents, such as transcripts and assignments, using local or cloud storage services.

6. **Announcements and Notifications:** Provide an announcements system, enabling administrators to post important updates. Implement real-time notifications for students and faculty, and create a calendar for scheduling classes, exams, and events.

7. **Search and Filtering:** Implement search and filtering functionality for students, courses, and faculty members, making it easier for users to find the information they need.

8. **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the application is responsive, adhering to responsive design principles and utilizing CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI to create a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

9. **Role-Based Access Control:** Define user roles (admin, faculty, student) and implement role-based access control. Users will have access to specific functionalities based on their roles, enhancing security and privacy.

10. **Reports and Analytics:** Collect and store relevant data about students, courses, and attendance. Utilize a data visualization library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js, or React-Chartjs-2) to create visual reports and charts. Fetch data from the server-side API using Axios or Fetch API.

## Scope

The scope of this project includes the development of a web application using React.js and TypeScript. The application will cover the following key features:

- User registration and authentication
- Dashboard with statistics and announcements
- Student and faculty management (CRUD operations)
- File upload and storage capabilities
- Announcements and notifications, with real-time updates
- Search and filtering functionalities
- Mobile-responsive design
- Role-based access control with different permissions for admin, faculty, and students.
- Reports and analytics, including data visualization.

The project's focus is on providing essential functionalities for college students, and it involves both front-end and back-end development. Data can be stored in the selected databases on the server side for more complex data management. Additionally, the project may involve data visualization and routing using React.js/Next.js to navigate between different sections of the application.
